If the primary node fails during a GC operation, the
extra node can obtain GC remaining progress if any and continue the GC operation from the value
segment with the smallest segment ID after recovery.
Note that backup nodes will update $D_i$ to $C_i$ for the failed primary node and return its ID
range of erasure-coded value segments starting from $D_i$ at the beginning of recovery.
